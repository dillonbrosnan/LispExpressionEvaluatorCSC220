Comiled with Netbeans 8.0.2. Much of this code was not written by myself, I only implemented
methods, which was part of assignment. LispExpressionException, StackInterface, and PJ2_Test
were not written by me. 

Files uses stacks and nodes linking items in stack to evaluate mathematical lisp expressions.
